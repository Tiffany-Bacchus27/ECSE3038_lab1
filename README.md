Question 1 takes the function, parallel(resistors), and outputs a value in ohms for the effective resistance when given a list of numbers as the argument. Firstly, the function checks if the list of resistors is empty and if it is then a message is printed indicating that no resistors were provided. The variable 'reciprocals' is used to store the calculation for each resistor value. If the total_sum is zero, it indicates infinite resistance, otherwise it calculates the effective resistance and prints the expression. 

Question 2 takes the function, potential_divider(resistors, total_voltage), and outputs the value of the voltage drop across each resistor in the list. The total resistance of the series circuit is calculated by summing the resistor values. The voltage drops across each resistor is calculated using a for loop with the index [i]. The function then prints the voltage drop across each resistor.  

Question 3 takes the function temperature_check(unit, temp). The keys 'C' and 'F' represent the units of temperature (Celsius and Fahrenheit), which maps to the dictionary limits, that contains the temperature limits for hypothermia annd hyperthermia. The function compares the temperature to the corresponding limits in the dictionary to determine if the patient is hypothermic, hyperthermic, or has a normal body temperature. Then prints the appropriate message based on the condition. 

These function were written to fulfill the tasks of Lab 1 for Engineering Internet of Thinsg Systems course. 



A SHORT JOKE: 


Why do programmers prefer dark mode...?



BECAUSE .......

Light 
attracts 
BUGS! 


Why did the computer engineer get stuck in the shower? 

Because the instructions on the shampoo bottle said: Lather, Rinse, Repeat.

Bazinga! :D
